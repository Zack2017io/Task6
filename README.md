Password Strength Testing & Security Best Practices
Task Summary:

In this task, I created a set of passwords with varying levels of complexity and tested their strength using online tools. The goal was to evaluate how password composition affects security and to learn how attackers commonly exploit weak passwords.

What Was Done
Multiple passwords were created, each with different combinations of letters, numbers, symbols, and lengths.

These passwords were tested using free online password strength checkers such as the one provided by security.org.

For each password, I noted the estimated time it would take to crack it, along with any feedback provided by the tool.

Key Learnings
Passwords that are longer and include a mix of character types are much harder to crack.

Short, common, or predictable passwords are easily broken in seconds.

Even if you use numbers and symbols, if the pattern is common, it may still be considered weak.

Using a password manager is highly recommended for storing unique, complex passwords for each site.

Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Always use at least 12 characters.

Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

Avoid using dictionary words, names, or personal information.

Use unique passwords for every account.

Consider creating memorable passphrases that are hard to guess but easy for you to remember.

Common Password Attack Methods
Brute Force Attack – The attacker tries every possible character combination. Long, complex passwords help resist this.

Dictionary Attack – Uses a predefined list of common passwords or words. Passwords like "qwerty" or "123456" are especially vulnerable.

Credential Stuffing – Stolen usernames and passwords from previous breaches are reused on other sites.

Phishing – Tricks users into revealing their password through fake emails or websites.

Conclusion
The complexity and uniqueness of a password significantly impact how secure it is. Strong passwords are essential to defending against the most common attack techniques. Regularly updating passwords and using a password manager can further enhance your security.
